# University Residence Allocation Restful WebAPI

## What we will be building 
* The purpose of this application is to allow students to be able to apply for residence at university.
* The allocation of rooms depends on the level of study, the number of available rooms and the average mark for the current year.
* Each student will require an account and a student is only eligible to apply for one room.
* All senior students (final year incl. postgraduates) are automatically allocated single rooms.
* Students are allowed to select a residence of their choice, and allocation will be based on a first come first serve.
